GitHub HW Assignment!

This is an edit from VS code!

And this is an edit from GitHub! Wowie zowie!

There we go... all better!

In this assignment I learned that gitlens really helps when resolving merges and also got a taste of why github is so useful... I am very inspired to go look at some open source code out there now, make a fork/copy, and test some things out! The sky is the limit!!!!

 # Elevator Pitch
 ## AnkiType
Do you ever have to memorize "elevator pitches" (like this one) for important business meetings, but find it takes too much time? Or do you have to memorize entire scripts for plays, but find the task seemingly impossible? If so, AnkiType is here to help you do just that - the impossible - in record time. AnkiType is a new tool that assists with passage memorization via a revolutionary, new memorization method called "typemory." Typemory consists of typing out words in a passage, starting with just several words at a time but building up to typing out the entire passage word-for-word, all from memory. Thanks to AnkiType, you can memorize passages in the same amount of time you would have spent worrying about it.

## Simon HTML Assignment

I learned how powerful html is albeit very basic looking. You can display all the information you need to in an organized manner, collect data from the user, and display images/shapes. I also learned that even if you set the language to english, you can still display Japanese text just fine.

The following line of code took me a while to understand, but then I realized it was setting the icon that shows in the tab on your browser! Pretty neat stuff, aye?
