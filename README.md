GitHub HW Assignment!

This is an edit from VS code!

And this is an edit from GitHub! Wowie zowie!

There we go... all better!

In this assignment I learned that gitlens really helps when resolving merges and also got a taste of why github is so useful... I am very inspired to go look at some open source code out there now, make a fork/copy, and test some things out! The sky is the limit!!!!
