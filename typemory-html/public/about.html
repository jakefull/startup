                <p>Really, though, this is just a startup website for my CS 260 class at Brigham Young University. But hey, if you find it useful, I hope you continue to use it!</p>
        
                <p>But interestingly enough, there is some background to this startup. I completed Basic Cadet Training at the United States Air Force Academy in the summer of 2018, during which time I had to memorize painstakingly long quotes in mere days, with little to no actual time to study. An example of one of these quotes is the one below:</p>
        
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment. On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army. It is possible to impart instruction and give commands in such a manner and such a tone of voice as to inspire in the soldier no feeling but an intense desire to obey, while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey.

                        The one mode or the other in dealing with subordinates springs from a corresponding spirit in the breast of the commander. He who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them respect for himself; while he who feels, and hence manifests, disrespect toward others, especially his subordinates, cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself.</p>
                  </blockquote>

                <p>I would have dreamed of having a tool as useful as Typemory available to me during basic training. Although, I have to admit, even if it was available, I am sure my cadre would have been sure to lay out some dire consequences for anyone who was caught using it. But now that I have finished basic training, I have the luxury of using tools such as Typemory to help me memorize things, and I hope you will enjoy this luxury with me (assuming you aren't in basic training right now :).</p>
    
                <p class="text-dark">I would like to mention that some of this code came from examples on bootstrap's website as well as some general outlines provided on previous homework assignments. However, I am the sole author of the website itself.</p>
