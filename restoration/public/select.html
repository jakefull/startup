                              One of the most important things to keep in mind as we study the restoration of the 
                              gospel is that Jesus Christ is truth; that is, in our efforts to come to the truth,
                              we must develop a relationsip with the Savior. We must recognize that we are not seeking 
                              after an absolute, abstract idealogy, but we are following a person - the only perfect person to have walked this earth.

                              Joseph's conviction regarding the experience he had as young boy, especially in the face of the adversity that came as a direct result of it, stands as a great testimony of the reality of the First Vision.

                               President Nelson then speaks to the power of the Book of Mormon, and encourages us to reflect on its importance to us. </p>

                              They were written in response to a request from John Wentworth, an editor at the Chicago Democrat. He wanted a list of statements about what members of the church believe in. 
                              The 13 statments that Joseph replied with are considered to include the "essential doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ." 
                            The fact that this article on the organization of the church is included in the Articles of Faith goes to show how important this doctrine is.

                               In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is actually the 67th section in chronological order, the Lord outlines one of the underlying themes of the restoration: "whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same." 
                               The Lord's promise is that all of His words shall be fulfilled, including those given through His servants. We can have faith and trust in the words of the prophets as they are the Lord's mouthpiece on the earth today.

                            <p class="card-text">Additional Restoration Scripture: One of the unique attributes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a belief in an open canon of scripture. 
                              We do not believe that scripture ceased with the New Testament. 
                              Instead, we believe that the Lord speaks to his servants on the earth today, and that through them we can receive additional scripture for our day.
                              This unique doctrine is emphasised in the Articles of Faith as we outline our belief in the Book of Mormon, a book of scripture revealed in the modern day. Speaking of our belief in an open canon, President Joseph F. Smith said, 
                              "Are we to understand, then, that God does not, and will not further make known his will to men; 
                              that what he has said suffices? His will to Moses and Isaiah and John is abundant for modern followers of Christ? 
                              The Latter-day Saints take issue with this doctrine, and pronounce it illogical, inconsistent, and untrue, 
                              and bear testimony to all the world that God lives and that he reveals his will to men who believe in him and who obey his commandments, as much in our day as at any time in the history of nations."

                            <p class="card-text">Zion, The Gathering, The Law, and Consecration: This quote comes from a sermon on mercy that Joseph Smith gave to the Relief Society on the 9th of June, 1842. 
                              Preceding the sermon, the Relief Society held a vote on whether certain women should be received into the Society. 
                              One of the women received into the Society had previously been objected. 
                              Commenting on this, the Prophet said, "Supposing that Jesus Christ and angels should object to us on frivolous things, what would become of us? 
                              We must be merciful and overlook small things." 
                              Joseph Smith then spoke of the power that comes from a feeling of unity.

                            Sister Sharon Eubank, the First Counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency, also gave a talk in the October 2020 centered on this quote from Joseph Smith. 
                            She first outlined how difficult it can be to understand others and create a "union of feeling" in today's polarized world, after which she offered three suggestions to overcome that difficulty: 
                            1) have mercy, 2) see the good in differences, and 3) rely on Jesus to resolve differences as we try to become one.

                              We come to understand that we, too, can become perfect like the Savior as we live according to the knowledge we have. 
                              However, unlike the Savior, we all fall short sometimes and need to rely on Him to redeem us.

                            <p class="card-text">Kirtland Opposition and Missouri Expulsion: This powerful section of scripture came from an epistle to the Church that Joseph Smith wrote from Liberty Jail. 
                              The letter was dated March 20, 1839. As the prophet suffered of isolation from many of the saints and from his family during a winter with record cold temperatures, he turned to the Lord and asked, 
                              "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?" 
                              The prophet was assuredly downhearted after the trials he had been called to pass through. 
                              But the Lord reassured the prophet with the following verses, reminding him that the Savior still suffered to support him even in a trial such as this. 
                              These two scriptures are also a powerful reminder that the Lord is in control of all things, and we need not fear as we place our trust in Him.

                            <p class="card-text">Nauvoo Doctrines: This quote is detailed in Thomas Bullock's, Willard Richards', and William Clayton's accounts of the King Follett sermon given by Joseph Smith on the 7th of April, 1844.
                              Preceding the quote, Joseph references how he has recently been studying the Bible in Hebrew, Greek, and German in addition to the English translation. 
                             He then states that "when we begin to learn in this way we beg to learn the only true God." 
                             He also says that "when we… know how to come unto him… he begins to unfold the heavens to us and tell us all about it bef[ore] our prayers get to his ears." 
                             The detail of God unfolding the heavens to us "before our prayers get to his ears" seems to coincide with the scripture in Matthew 6, "your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him." 
                             This is a wonderful example that supports Joseph's claim, "I know the scriptures and understand them," in addition to some of his excerpts such as "how can we escape the damnation of hell without God reveal[ing] to us?" 
                           This quote highlights the importance of God unfolding the heavens to us.

                            <p class="card-text">Eternal and Plural Marriage: This particular quote comes from a discourse given by the prophet in Nauvoo and recorded by Wilford Woodruff on the 10th of March, 1844. 
                              The prophet speaks of the sealing power, and how we ought to use it as much as we can here in this life. 
                              In particular, it is interesting to note the word "wise," which was originally recorded by Wilford Woodruff as "crafty." 
                              While there is a slight difference in meaning of those two words, I think the overall message is that we should seal all we can in this life. 
                              This quote hints at and explains some of the dynastic sealings which occured in Nauvoo, with the idea of linking the family of God together horizontally in addition to vertically.

                            <p class="card-text">Martyrdom, Succession, and Western Exodus: One of the most powerful quotes given by the prophet comes from the third of six volumes of the "Manuscript History of the Church." 
                              Joseph Smith wrote of the missionaries traveling to Great Britain and how five thousand had already joined the "Standard of Truth" from there. 
                              He then speaks of missionaries going to more and more nations, such as "Germany, Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies" and more. 
                              Joseph's prophetic calling is then made apparent once more as he speaks of the church going forth, despite all the persecution and opposition that will arise against it, to fill all the earth. 
                              Today, we are seeing the fulfillment of this prophecy as missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints go forth to serve in over 411 missions throughout the world.

                            <p class="card-text">Continuing Revelation: This quote comes from a devotional address titled "Meek and Lowly," given by Elder Neal A. Maxwell at Brigham Young University on October 21, 1986. 
                              Fitting with the theme of this unit, Elder Maxwell talks of how even in our day, for those who have "eyes to see and ears to hear," it is obvious that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are still pouring out knowledge upon the heads of the saints.
                               However, in order to receive that revelation and knowledge of the "secrets of the universe," Elder Maxwell reminds us that we need to be meek and lowly in heart.

                              The most exciting developments of our day are all part of what has been prophesied to come, the last dispensation before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. 
                              President Uchtdorf also reminds us that ancient prophets yearned to see our day.
